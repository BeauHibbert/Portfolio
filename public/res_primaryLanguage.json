      "description": "My name is Beau Hibbert, I attended Washington State University to study economics and eventually got a job in the banking industry. After working for a couple of years, I came to the conclusion that the banking industry was not the right fit for me and decided that being a software engineer would be a smart move as it's one of the fastest growing industries. I really enjoy doing research and applying that newfound knowledge to increase performance in myself and others. With my background in economics and now software engineering, I am looking towards finding a role where I can continue to develop my skills and solve complex problems.",
